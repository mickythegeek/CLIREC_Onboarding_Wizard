Conditions to filter transactions per file
     
     The files listed from 1 to 16 are all in the same format:

a.	For all the INWARD reports, sort according to column J (DESTINATION INSTITUTION) to copy out FIRST CITY MONUMENT BANK.
b.	Move the TRANSACTION TIME on column G to column A.
c.	Move the session ID on column C to column B.
d.	Move NARRATION from column M to column C.
e.	Move AMOUNT from column F to column E.
f.	Create empty 3 columns on column F,G and H.
g.	Extract from right 23 characters from session ID on column B and put on column G.


     From Finacle report:
a.	Sort according to column E (PART_TRAN_TYPE) and negate all the items on column I (TRAN_AMT) with D sign on column E.
b.	Move TRAN_DATE from column G to column A.
c.	Cut from column M (TRAN_PARTICULAR_2) to column B.
d.	Cut from column J (TRAN_PARTICULAR) to column C.
e.	Cut from column F (VALUE_DATE) to column D.
f.	Cut from column I (TRAN_AMOUNT) to column E.
g.	Extract from right 23 characters from column B (TRAN_PARTICULAR_2) and put on column G.
h.	Run V.lookup on column G to identify match items.
     
The amount in both Ledger and NIBSS reports are always the same for NIP INWARD GL.
For the OUTWARD files, look for the session IDs that have the first six characters as 9. These are the items in the OUTWARD files that impact the NIP INWARD GL and the mode of extracting the reconciliation parameters is the same with what has been explained for the INWARD files above.

For NIP INWARD GL, there are 12 sessions as listed below.

File conditions to filter transactions per file
Filter according to column S (Settlement_Impact_Desc) and pick only Amount_receivable. Being a receivable account, the line by line amounts on column R (Settlement_Impact) are left as credit. Should there be debit amounts, run V-Look up of these against the credit amounts to match out auto reversed transactions using Retrieval_Reference_Nr. Add N25 to each of the amounts on column R (Settlement_Impact). The amounts on this column R (Settlement_Impact) are summed up and the bulk summed figure is negated to make everything on column R to be zero. 
On Finacle download, the column named PART_TRAN_TYPE is contained D & C. All the items with ‘D’ are negated. Extract from column named TRAN_REMARKS the first 12 digits from left. Run V Look-up of the TRAN_AMOUNT with ‘D’ against the TRAN_AMOUNT with ‘C’ using the 12 digits extracted from the TRAN_REMARKS columns to match out auto reversed transactions.
Compare the amounts on the settlement side with what is on the Finacle side using Retrieval_Reference_Nr to identify match items.

The settlement file does not contain Retrieval Reference Number and to get this, Procash report is required from Data Science team.
Retrieval Reference Number is populated from Procash into the settlement report using Auth ID for reconciliation to happen.
Any transaction that is in the settlement report not in the Finacle report is an unimpacted transaction which will be a shortage in the ATM till.
Any transaction that is in Finacle report not in the settlement file is, all thing being equal, a failed transaction which will be an overage in the ATM till.
Entries to debit the credit cardholders for the settled transactions are done manually using the cardholders’ account number, Auth ID and the transaction date as narration.
Extract the cardholders’ account number and auth ID and concatenate the two to run v-look up to identify match items.
